# NHLPlayerStatsProject
Data analytics project for the Career Foundry Data Immersion course which utilizes Python to clean and manipulate a dataset of your choice in order to create a custom analysis. I chose a NHL player statistic dataset that was acquired from kaggle.com.
## Introduction and Objective
A USHL junior hockey team is looking for statistical player insights that contribute to elite NHL fowards and defensemen. The team recruiters would like to utilize this information for improved recruiting and overall team success. The data will be analyzed to find insights about elite players and any correlations towards what contributes to higher production statistics. 

## Key Questions:
1) Which players are the overall top producers in goals, points, and time on ice?
2) Which statistics contribute towards elite NHL defensemen?
3) Which statistics contribute towards elite NHL forwards?
4) Which statistics factor into different player roles for forwards and defensemen?
5) Do certain teams have better overall player statistics throughout the timeframe of this dataset?

## Data Source:
This dataset contains a variety of NHL player statistics for every player and team from the 2004-2018 season.

NHL Player Stats dataset from Kaggle and data was aquired from www.hockey-reference.com
